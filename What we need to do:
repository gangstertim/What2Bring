What we need to do:

Fix the application helper.  On posting the event with the submit button, the string in the date field needs to parsed and passed to the database via mr helper.

also, we still need to get rid of the time column in the database.


So currently we've generated a scaffold for guests

We are trying to find a way to make a new guest belong to the event it was created from.  We've been fiddling around with the guests_controller form.
